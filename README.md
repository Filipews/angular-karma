This is an extension of the https://github.com/Filipews/angular-base app. This version adds karma test runner (http://karma-runner.github.io/) and unit testing.

Simplistic angular base app using only 'npm' as package manager.

External packages are all using 'cdnjs' libs to take advantage of web browser caching when loading the app.
